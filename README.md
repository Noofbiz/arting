# arting
A repo to keep some awesome arts

That's about it. I'll just make each one in its own folder. Just to make stuff.
Currently, I'm looking at [model3d](https://github.com/unixpickle/model3d) but
I may branch out into more libraries as well! This repo is really for my own
learning and entertainment, so enjoy!
